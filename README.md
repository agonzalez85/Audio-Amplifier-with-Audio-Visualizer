# Audio-Amplifier-with-Audio-Visualizer

This project is an Audio amplifier with an integrated 7-band Audio Visualizer using an Arduino Nano, MSGEQ7 frequency analyzer chip, and an OLED display. This project is part of a custom PCB audio amplifier project that includes stereo sound output and user controls in volume, amplifier gain, and bass boost. The visualizer reads audio frequency data from the MSGEQ7 chip, processes it, and displays a bar graph of the 7 bands on the OLED screen. The frequency bands displayed are 63 Hz, 160 Hz, 400 Hz, 1 kHz, 2.5 kHz, 6.3 kHz, and 16 kHz.
