# Audio-Amplifier-with-Audio-Visualizer

## Description
This project is an Audio Amplfier with an integreated 7-band Audio Visualizer using an Arduino Nano, MSGEQ7 frequency analyzer chip, and an OLED display.
This project is a part of a custom PCB audio amplifier project that includes stereo sound output and user controls in volume, amplfier gain, and bass boost.

The visualizer reads audio freuqnecy data from the MSGEQ7 chip, processes it, and displays and bar graph representation of the 7 bands on the OLED screen.  
The frequency bands displayed are: 63 Hz, 160 Hz, 400 Hz, 1 kHz, 2.5 kHz, 6.3 kHz, and 16 kHz.
